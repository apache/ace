Building Apache ACE
===================

Initial Setup
--------------

1)  Install J2SE 6 SDK (or later), which can be downloaded from
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
    Use version of "JDK 6 Update 22" (or later)

2)  Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly
    installed JDK location, and that your PATH includes
    %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or $JAVA_HOME/bin (unix).

3)  Install Maven 3.0.2 (or later), which can be downloaded from
    http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes
    the MAVEN_HOME/bin directory.

Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of Apache ACE source distribution.
2) Run
        $> mvn
   This will compile Apache ACE and run all of the tests.
   You can run
        $> mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    This will compile Apache ACE without running the tests.
3) The distributions will be available under "assembly/target" directory.
